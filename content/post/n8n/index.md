Welcome to this guide on n8n! ðŸ‘‹

## What is n8n?

n8n is a powerful, free, and open-source workflow automation tool. It enables you to connect different applications and services to automate repetitive tasks without extensive coding. You can design complex workflows visually, using a wide array of pre-built nodes for popular apps and services, or even create your own custom nodes. This flexibility makes n8n a versatile solution for personal projects, business process automation, and more.

## Core n8n Architecture

Understanding n8n's architecture helps in leveraging its full potential, especially when it comes to scaling, customizing, or embedding n8n. While deep technical details can be extensive, here's a high-level overview of its key components:

### Key Components

1.  **The n8n Editor (Frontend/UI):**
    *   This is the visual interface where you design and manage your workflows.
    *   It's a web application, typically built with modern JavaScript frameworks.
    *   When you create a workflow, the editor essentially generates a JSON representation of that workflow.

2.  **Workflow Execution Engine (Backend/Worker):**
    *   This is the core engine responsible for actually running your workflows.
    *   It takes the JSON definition of a workflow and processes it step-by-step.
    *   It handles node execution, data transformation between nodes, error handling, and logging.
    *   For scalability, n8n can run in different modes, including a "main" process and separate "worker" processes that can handle concurrent workflow executions. This is often referred to as "Queue Mode" for more robust, production-grade deployments.

3.  **Nodes:**
    *   **Trigger Nodes:** These are special nodes that start a workflow. They can be activated by webhooks, schedules (cron), manual triggers, or events from third-party services.
    *   **Regular Nodes:** These perform specific actions like reading data from a database, sending an email, manipulating data, making API calls, or implementing custom logic.
    *   Each node is essentially a self-contained unit of code (often JavaScript/TypeScript) that performs a specific task.

4.  **Database:**
    *   n8n uses a database (SQLite by default, but PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB are supported for production) to store:
        *   Workflow definitions
        *   Credentials for connecting to various services
        *   Execution logs and history
        *   User data (if user management is enabled)

5.  **REST API:**
    *   n8n exposes a REST API that allows for programmatic interaction. You can use this API to manage workflows, trigger executions, retrieve execution data, and more, enabling integration with other systems.

### How It Works Together (Simplified Flow)
{{< figure src="images/flow.png" alt="Core n8n flow" >}}

1.  **Design:** You design a workflow in the n8n Editor. Your workflow is saved as a JSON object in the database.
2.  **Trigger:** A trigger node initiates the workflow (e.g., an incoming webhook request, a scheduled time).
3.  **Execution:**
    *   The Workflow Execution Engine loads the workflow's JSON definition from the database.
    *   It starts with the trigger node and executes subsequent nodes in the defined order.
    *   Data output from one node becomes the input for the next, allowing for complex data flows and transformations.
    *   The engine communicates with external services as defined by the nodes (e.g., fetching data from an API, sending a message to Slack).
4.  **Logging:** Execution details, including successes, failures, and data at each step, are logged in the database.

### Scalability Considerations

*   **Execution Modes:** n8n can run in a single `main` process mode (default, good for smaller setups) or a `queue` mode with dedicated worker processes for better performance and scalability, especially when handling many concurrent workflows.
*   **Database Choice:** For production environments, using PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB instead of SQLite is recommended for better performance and reliability under load.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Sufficient CPU, memory, and network bandwidth are crucial, especially for worker instances handling complex or high-volume workflows.

## Planning Your Custom Node

Before writing any code, itâ€™s important to plan your custom n8n node carefully. This ensures your node is maintainable, user-friendly, and fits well within your workflow automation goals.

### 1. Choosing the Node Type

n8n nodes generally fall into two categories:
- **Trigger Nodes:** Start workflows when an event occurs (e.g., webhook received, new email).
- **Regular (Action) Nodes:** Perform actions or process data within a workflow (e.g., HTTP request, data transformation).

**Questions to consider:**
- Should your node initiate workflows (Trigger) or process data mid-flow (Action)?
- Does your node need to poll an external service, or will it wait for incoming events?

### 2. Selecting a Node Building Style

n8n supports two main approaches for building nodes:
- **Core/Monorepo Node:** Node is added directly to the n8n core repository (recommended for contributions to the main project).
- **Community/External Node:** Node is developed as a standalone npm package (ideal for sharing independently or keeping private).

**Repo Layout Example:**
```
n8n/
  packages/
    nodes-base/
      nodes/
        MyCustomNode/
          MyCustomNode.node.ts
          MyCustomNode.description.json
          MyCustomNode.credentials.json
```
For external/community nodes, the structure might look like:
```
n8n-nodes-my-custom/
  package.json
  src/
    MyCustomNode.node.ts
    MyCustomNode.description.json
    MyCustomNode.credentials.json
  README.md
```

### 3. Designing the Node UI

The user interface for your node in the n8n Editor is defined by its `description` object:
- **Display Name & Description:** Choose clear, concise names and helpful descriptions.
- **Inputs & Outputs:** Decide how data will flow into and out of your node.
- **Parameters:** Plan which fields, dropdowns, credentials, and options users will interact with.
- **Defaults & Appearance:** Set default values and color for easy identification.

**Tips for UI Design:**
- Group related parameters for clarity.
- Use descriptive labels and tooltips.
- Minimize required fields to streamline the user experience.
- Consider advanced options for power users, but keep the main UI simple.
