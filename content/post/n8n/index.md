Welcome to this guide on n8n! ðŸ‘‹

## What is n8n?

n8n is a powerful, free, and open-source workflow automation tool. It enables you to connect different applications and services to automate repetitive tasks without extensive coding. You can design complex workflows visually, using a wide array of pre-built nodes for popular apps and services, or even create your own custom nodes. This flexibility makes n8n a versatile solution for personal projects, business process automation, and more.

## Core n8n Architecture

Understanding n8n's architecture helps in leveraging its full potential, especially when it comes to scaling, customizing, or embedding n8n. While deep technical details can be extensive, here's a high-level overview of its key components:

### Key Components

1.  **The n8n Editor (Frontend/UI):**
    *   This is the visual interface where you design and manage your workflows.
    *   It's a web application, typically built with modern JavaScript frameworks.
    *   When you create a workflow, the editor essentially generates a JSON representation of that workflow.

2.  **Workflow Execution Engine (Backend/Worker):**
    *   This is the core engine responsible for actually running your workflows.
    *   It takes the JSON definition of a workflow and processes it step-by-step.
    *   It handles node execution, data transformation between nodes, error handling, and logging.
    *   For scalability, n8n can run in different modes, including a "main" process and separate "worker" processes that can handle concurrent workflow executions. This is often referred to as "Queue Mode" for more robust, production-grade deployments.

3.  **Nodes:**
    *   **Trigger Nodes:** These are special nodes that start a workflow. They can be activated by webhooks, schedules (cron), manual triggers, or events from third-party services.
    *   **Regular Nodes:** These perform specific actions like reading data from a database, sending an email, manipulating data, making API calls, or implementing custom logic.
    *   Each node is essentially a self-contained unit of code (often JavaScript/TypeScript) that performs a specific task.

4.  **Database:**
    *   n8n uses a database (SQLite by default, but PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB are supported for production) to store:
        *   Workflow definitions
        *   Credentials for connecting to various services
        *   Execution logs and history
        *   User data (if user management is enabled)

5.  **REST API:**
    *   n8n exposes a REST API that allows for programmatic interaction. You can use this API to manage workflows, trigger executions, retrieve execution data, and more, enabling integration with other systems.

### How It Works Together (Simplified Flow)
{{< figure src="images/flow.png" alt="Core n8n flow" >}}

1.  **Design:** You design a workflow in the n8n Editor. Your workflow is saved as a JSON object in the database.
2.  **Trigger:** A trigger node initiates the workflow (e.g., an incoming webhook request, a scheduled time).
3.  **Execution:**
    *   The Workflow Execution Engine loads the workflow's JSON definition from the database.
    *   It starts with the trigger node and executes subsequent nodes in the defined order.
    *   Data output from one node becomes the input for the next, allowing for complex data flows and transformations.
    *   The engine communicates with external services as defined by the nodes (e.g., fetching data from an API, sending a message to Slack).
4.  **Logging:** Execution details, including successes, failures, and data at each step, are logged in the database.

### Scalability Considerations

*   **Execution Modes:** n8n can run in a single `main` process mode (default, good for smaller setups) or a `queue` mode with dedicated worker processes for better performance and scalability, especially when handling many concurrent workflows.
*   **Database Choice:** For production environments, using PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB instead of SQLite is recommended for better performance and reliability under load.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Sufficient CPU, memory, and network bandwidth are crucial, especially for worker instances handling complex or high-volume workflows.

## Creating a Custom Node (Brief Overview)

While n8n offers a vast library of nodes, you might encounter scenarios where you need a specific integration or functionality not yet available. n8n's architecture allows developers to create custom nodes using Node.js (TypeScript). This involves:

1.  Setting up a development environment.
2.  Defining the node's properties (inputs, outputs, UI elements).
3.  Writing the execution logic for the node.
4.  Packaging and (optionally) sharing your custom node with the community.

This extensibility is a key strength of n8n, allowing it to adapt to virtually any automation need.
