Welcome to this guide on n8n! 👋

{{< toc mobile_only=true is_open=true >}}

## What is n8n?

n8n is a powerful, free, and open-source workflow automation tool. It enables you to connect different applications and services to automate repetitive tasks without extensive coding. You can design complex workflows visually, using a wide array of pre-built nodes for popular apps and services, or even create your own custom nodes. This flexibility makes n8n a versatile solution for personal projects, business process automation, and more.

## Core n8n Architecture

Understanding n8n's architecture helps in leveraging its full potential, especially when it comes to scaling, customizing, or embedding n8n. While deep technical details can be extensive, here's a high-level overview of its key components:

{{< figure src="images/architecture.png" alt="Core n8n Architecture" >}}

### Key Components

1.  **The n8n Editor (Frontend/UI):**
    *   This is the visual interface where you design and manage your workflows.
    *   It's a web application, typically built with modern JavaScript frameworks.
    *   When you create a workflow, the editor essentially generates a JSON representation of that workflow.

2.  **Workflow Execution Engine (Backend/Worker):**
    *   This is the core engine responsible for actually running your workflows.
    *   It takes the JSON definition of a workflow and processes it step-by-step.
    *   It handles node execution, data transformation between nodes, error handling, and logging.
    *   For scalability, n8n can run in different modes, including a "main" process and separate "worker" processes that can handle concurrent workflow executions. This is often referred to as "Queue Mode" for more robust, production-grade deployments.

3.  **Nodes:**
    *   **Trigger Nodes:** These are special nodes that start a workflow. They can be activated by webhooks, schedules (cron), manual triggers, or events from third-party services.
    *   **Regular Nodes:** These perform specific actions like reading data from a database, sending an email, manipulating data, making API calls, or implementing custom logic.
    *   Each node is essentially a self-contained unit of code (often JavaScript/TypeScript) that performs a specific task.

4.  **Database:**
    *   n8n uses a database (SQLite by default, but PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB are supported for production) to store:
        *   Workflow definitions
        *   Credentials for connecting to various services
        *   Execution logs and history
        *   User data (if user management is enabled)

5.  **REST API:**
    *   n8n exposes a REST API that allows for programmatic interaction. You can use this API to manage workflows, trigger executions, retrieve execution data, and more, enabling integration with other systems.

### How It Works Together (Simplified Flow)
{{< figure src="images/flow.png" alt="Core n8n flow" >}}

1.  **Design:** You design a workflow in the n8n Editor. Your workflow is saved as a JSON object in the database.
2.  **Trigger:** A trigger node initiates the workflow (e.g., an incoming webhook request, a scheduled time).
3.  **Execution:**
    *   The Workflow Execution Engine loads the workflow's JSON definition from the database.
    *   It starts with the trigger node and executes subsequent nodes in the defined order.
    *   Data output from one node becomes the input for the next, allowing for complex data flows and transformations.
    *   The engine communicates with external services as defined by the nodes (e.g., fetching data from an API, sending a message to Slack).
4.  **Logging:** Execution details, including successes, failures, and data at each step, are logged in the database.

### Scalability Considerations

*   **Execution Modes:** n8n can run in a single `main` process mode (default, good for smaller setups) or a `queue` mode with dedicated worker processes for better performance and scalability, especially when handling many concurrent workflows.
*   **Database Choice:** For production environments, using PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB instead of SQLite is recommended for better performance and reliability under load.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Sufficient CPU, memory, and network bandwidth are crucial, especially for worker instances handling complex or high-volume workflows.

## Planning Your Custom Node

Before writing any code, it’s important to plan your custom n8n node carefully. This ensures your node is maintainable, user-friendly, and fits well within your workflow automation goals.

### 1. Choosing the Node Type

n8n nodes generally fall into two categories:
- **Trigger Nodes:** Start workflows when an event occurs (e.g., webhook received, new email).
- **Regular (Action) Nodes:** Perform actions or process data within a workflow (e.g., HTTP request, data transformation).

**Questions to consider:**
- Should your node initiate workflows (Trigger) or process data mid-flow (Action)?
- Does your node need to poll an external service, or will it wait for incoming events?

### 2. Selecting a Node Building Style

n8n supports two main approaches for building nodes:
- **Declarative Style:** Uses JSON to define node properties, inputs, outputs, and operations. This approach is simpler, more maintainable, and recommended for straightforward integrations.
  - **Routing-Based Development:** Declarative style excels at creating HTTP-based nodes through a routing system.
  - **Simplified API Integration:** Easily map API endpoints to operations without complex code.
  - **Operation-Centric:** Define multiple operations (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) in a structured way.
- **Programmatic Style:** Uses TypeScript code to define node behavior, offering more flexibility and control for complex logic or custom functionality.

**Declarative Style Example with HTTP Routing:**
```json
{
  "name": "MyApiNode",
  "httpRequestDefaults": {
    "baseURL": "https://api.example.com/v1",
    "headers": {
      "Accept": "application/json"
    }
  },
  "properties": [
    {
      "displayName": "Resource",
      "name": "resource",
      "type": "options",
      "options": [
        {
          "name": "User",
          "value": "user"
        },
        {
          "name": "Product",
          "value": "product"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "displayName": "Operation",
      "name": "operation",
      "type": "options",
      "options": [
        {
          "name": "Get",
          "value": "get",
          "routing": {
            "request": {
              "method": "GET",
              "url": "=/{{$parameter.resource}}/{{$parameter.id}}"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "Create",
          "value": "create",
          "routing": {
            "request": {
              "method": "POST",
              "url": "=/{{$parameter.resource}}",
              "body": "={{$parameter.data}}"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Programmatic Style Example:**
```typescript
export class MyCustomNode implements INodeType {
  description = {
    displayName: 'My Custom Node',
    // Other properties
  };

  async execute() {
    // Custom logic implementation
    // More flexibility and control
  }
}
```

You can also use a hybrid approach, combining declarative definitions with programmatic execution when needed.

**Repository Layout for n8n-node-starter:**

When developing custom nodes using the n8n-node-starter template, your project structure will typically look like this:

```
n8n-nodes-my-custom/
├── credentials/          # Credential definitions for your nodes
│   └── MyServiceApi.credentials.ts
├── nodes/                # Your custom node implementations
│   ├── MyService/
│   │   ├── MyService.node.ts           # Main node implementation
│   │   ├── MyService.node.json         # Declarative definition (if used)
│   │   └── descriptions/               # Localized descriptions
│   │       └── MyServiceDescription.ts
│   └── actions/                        # Reusable actions
│       └── common.ts
├── package.json          # Project configuration and dependencies
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
├── .eslintrc.js          # Linting rules
├── README.md             # Documentation
└── LICENSE.md            # License information
```

**Test Node:**
You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:
```bash
npm install n8n -g
```
2. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:
```bash
# In your node directory
npm run build
npm link
```
3. Install the node into your local n8n instance:
```bash
# In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
# node-package-name is the name from the package.json
npm link <node-package-name>
```

### 3. Designing the Node UI

The user interface for your node in the n8n Editor is defined by its `description` object:
- **Display Name & Description:** Choose clear, concise names and helpful descriptions.
- **Inputs & Outputs:** Decide how data will flow into and out of your node.
- **Parameters:** Plan which fields, dropdowns, credentials, and options users will interact with.
- **Defaults & Appearance:** Set default values and color for easy identification.

**Tips for UI Design:**
- Group related parameters for clarity.
- Use descriptive labels and tooltips.
- Minimize required fields to streamline the user experience.
- Consider advanced options for power users, but keep the main UI simple.
